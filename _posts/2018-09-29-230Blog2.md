Having introduced the Song Exploder project in the last blog, it's time to get into the production state. Honestly, I haven't made much progress since the last blog, but I have secured some musicians to come in next week. So this week has been more pre-production. 

Tempo. 
One of the issues, or rather a dilemma, was the tempo of the original song. Paramore's Still Into You was played at a tempo of 135 beats per minute, which is relatively fast when compared to Coldplay. The Mylo Xyloto contains a few songs that actually differ from each other in terms of style, and having listened to it on repeat for a while, I've picked one song from the album to act as a reference.

This is the sonic style I am aiming for. Having that in mind, I got into the studio over the weekend with Luke so play some scratch drums and to get a feel for the tempo. We spent about three hours in the studio just trying different drum patterns and tempo, and ended up with a tempo of around 110BPM. Having it being scratch tracks, there was nothing crazy about the setup. Just a microphone on the kick, snare, hats, and a pair of overheads. It was more about getting a grove and pattern down.

I'm looking forward to getting some musicians in next week to record the core of the song!
