#Song Exploder WIP 2

Production for my Song Exploder project continues. By now I've just finished up recording piano for the track. To me, this is one of the most important element. A friend of mine is a great pianist and gladly came in to play for me. With her sitting at the piano, we went back and forth on the idea of the song. What should be played, how it should be played, the song structure and any other questions pertaining. Hours went by before we settled on the final tracking that time permitted. Without a limit on studio time, I'm pretty sure we could have been there from the morning to night. To sum it up, we decided to slow down the tempo even more from what I did previously and decided to end the song on the tags of the song. It felt better, as slowing down the tempo does increase the overall duration of the track. If we didn't the track itself could have been about eight minutes long.

I was happy with the performance captured. I went into this project with the piano and vocals as the key element I want to capture. I know the recording is imperfect with the sounds of the piano mechanism coming through at times, but there was only so much I could do without bringing in another piano. I also didn't want to use a digital piano, I knew I wanted the natural sound of a real piano. 

Having done the piano, I laid out some drums and some synths in Ableton to help fill up space. Nothing really fancy to talk about there other than I ruled out acoustic drums. Listening back to the reference, Up In Flames, it was obvious that the drums used were samples.
