### Studio Roles
For the first recording session of the soundalike project my role was the Pro Tools operator. This role is crucial as with the other, but without a Pro Tools operator, there would be no recordings done. My main responsibilites included:
* setting ProTools with the correct input and outputs
* recording each take - either from the start or wherever the artist or producer wanted
* playback takes
* compare different takes
* ensure a good gain structure going into the session.


Summarise your role. Did you have to learn any new skills?
How did you contribute to running of the session...
How well did you achieve this...?
Anything you could have done better?
