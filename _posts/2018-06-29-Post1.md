## What's in the world of post production?	

I've concluded my unit of audio production and now I have started the post production unit. Going into this unit, my understanding of it was that it's pretty anything not related to music. Having said that I walked in with an open mind to see what it actually is about and what it offers.  


Post production audio is not limited to anything, it basically isn't music. It deals with voiceovers, foley, and sound effects. These things can be used for films or to simple public announcements. Our project for this unit is to take a movie scene, animation scene, or a moive tralier and strip all of its audio and recreate it from scratch. It's an interesting challenege to do. My group of Brice, Mitch, Brendon, and Juneel choice to do the Army of Darkness Trailer. 

One of the first things we did, was to change our counter to timecode versus what I was used to of bars and beat. Timecode dose make sense, for each frame can be represented in time. If bars and beats are for music, timecode is for videos. That's pretty much it. Another industry standard I learnt was where to put the film itself on the timeline. In Australia, we start it at the ten hour mark, which is represented by 10:00:00:00. Where it goes hours, minutes, seconds, and frames. The same way in music where we start things on the second bar. It gives us space to add things before it.

In the afternoon, we started doing voice overs of the trailer. Our setup was simple, and recording was done in the same room. It's a little odd, but it dose work if we mute the speakers and everyone stays silent. We setup an SE-2000 large diaphram condenser microphone, surrounded by a vocal halo to trap all the reflections, a pop filter in front of the microphone to trap all the plosives, and a music stand for the vocal lines. As much as vocalist sings a performace, ADR is a performance as well.

As we made progess, I guess we lucked in since our trailer had very little lines said on screens that would require synchronization. If a character is moving thier lips, but you don't hear it, then it would have been done poorly. We'll finish up our voiceovers soon, and next week we'll start on foley.
