## How	is	the	demo	production	progressing	and	what	are	the	most	pressing	issues?

It's been another week of the music instensive and I must say Distant Friend is really turning into a full song. A few things happened since last week. Drums are almost done. We're using program drums to save on time on editing and tracking, and we already have a lot of guitar layers. Drums are eighty percent done. We'll lock on the sound and the midi of it early next week. Guitars. We tracked a lot of layers and we definetly have enough layers for a rock song. The highlight I like to mention would be the tambourine and shakers. Brice jumped in and tracked those, and it went really well. 

However, we're still missing one insturment. Vocals. This will make or break the song. We have yet to lock in a vocalist, but I believe Luke may have one lined up for next week.
