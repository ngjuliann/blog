### EMP Remix Plan
I will be remixing, Veritas's song Knockout. It is pretty simple singer-songwriter song with vocals paired with an acoustic guitar. The song itself has a tempo of around 155bpm. It has a simple song structure of verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge and outro. 

My plan for the remix will start off with an increase of tempo. The original song itself-makes you want to tap your foot, and I would like to speed it up slightly to help get it more into a dance-poppy vibe. I would like to include a rhythm section, particular drums. A bass or synth bass will be added as well. For the chorus, I plan to make it bigger by layer different synth sounds and possibly the arpeggiator to create a unique sound. For my music theory is very limited, I believe the arpeggiator will help me find different notes that will sound fit with the original tune and possibly come up with some catchy melody. 

As for inspiration and style, I took Dabin for the ideas for the chorus for it to be full on. As I don't have the best knowledge in terms of playing music, I will try to pick out different parts in his songs that help create layers. For example, his song has a solid kick sound driving the song before the chorus, I will replicate this with a similar kick sound I will use on a drum rack. When the chorus hits, a lot more of the drums will be present. I won't be making a lot of fancy melodies as that is not my strength, but rather different sounds and loops from the same chord progressions.
