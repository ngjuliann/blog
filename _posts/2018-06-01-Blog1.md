## What is the 	most interesting new technique, concept or tool that I learnt this	week in my specific intensive?

My first intensive unit for the AUS220 course is the music production stream. My group, which consists of Luke, Brendon, Mitch, Brice, and myself, were tasked to turn a given demo into a full-on song. The original demo called, Distant Friend, only consisted of an acoustic guitar and a male vocal.

First our first session, we got an overview of the console. Since audio theory doesn’t change depending on the console, but rather just the layout. It wasn’t long before we all felt comfortable behind the board. From then, we started doing some rough drum recordings to really feel out the demo and see which direction we wanted to go. The first thing we adjust was the tempo of the song. We ended the drum sessions with a tempo between 108 and 115 beats per minute. Following the scratch drums, we laid out some guitars part to develop the song. Once again everything was really scratch and more for us as a group to see where we wanted to go in terms of the song. 

The biggest thing in the first week I picked up was the Neve Genesys console. It had a very different layout than the Audient I’ve previously worked on. I found it the fact the console itself is an analogue console but with a digital controller really intrigued me. For example, on the Audient, every potentiometer is all laid out and just turning it already would already have an effect.  Whereas for the Neve, in order for something to be achieved, it would usually have to be enabled before it can take effect.

The sound of the console also differs. After spending some time on the Neve, the Audient sounded very sterile and transparent. On the other hand, the Neve had a warmer tone and it just sounded more enjoyable to work on. I do look forward to spending more time on the console, and especially playing previous work so hear what it’ll sound like on this console.
