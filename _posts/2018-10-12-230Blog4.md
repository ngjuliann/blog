#Song Exploder Final

In the final week of production, I added vocals. I knew a friend of mine that had a unique voice and I thought he would fit the style of Coldplay. While finishing up the mix, I started to reflect on the whole process from start to finish this project. The goal of this project was to create a track in the style of a chosen producer. While working on this project, I felt like this was a lot harder to put into practice. For example, I had a plan with the piano before the recording of it. However, during the production of it, I stopped several times and just asked myself, "Would Rik Simpson do this for Coldplay?" The more I continued to work on it, the more I wanted to make it my own track and project. I wanted to make it my track with my style added to it. But that simply wasn't the project. I only had an idea of what I wanted to walk out of the studio with, but to produce what I wanted versus what I needed was a little challenging.  

If I had more time, I would definitely spend more time on trying to make the track more like how Rik Simpson would. In the end, due to the time-crunch, I know I was close. I had the vibe, but I didn't feel like I achieved 100% for the project goal.
