## “Progress Update”

The army of darkness trailer is what my group has been working on. Since the beginning, I've learnt a lot in terms of what goes into audio aspect of any film. In a sense, because our group is doing a movie trailer, it's like a hybrid blend between a movie dialouge scene, and all the actions scenes of the movie. A trailer should get an audience's interested enough to get them to watch the whole movie. 

Having said that everything is going well. We're still doing foley recording and we have all the dialouge done and locked in. Just having a listen with the foley, it just sounds empty. But just having a discussion we my group members, that's totally fine as we haev yet to add the soundtrack to it and that should fill all the gaps between all the sound effects.
