## “AUS220 Reflective Blog”

As the this trimester has just concluded, it'd be good to look back on it and reflect. So here are some questions and I'll bring the answers

#### What have you created this trimester - Post-Production, Music, Live, Podcast?
Well this trimester, it was pretty divided into three chuncks; music production, post production and finally live productions. In the first one, music production, working with some of my classmates, we took a demo of a song and brought it into full on produced song. In the second one, post production, the same group of us took a movie trailer and stripped it all of its sound and recreated it. Finally, in the live production, we had a twenty minute gig with a newly signed band, Bell City Square. 


#### What have you learnt this trimester?

This biggest thing I have learnt this trimester is to have a bigger perspective on audio.  I learnt a lot in regards to post production. It's something I have never tried, I guess I didn't know how I would even begin to try it. Post requires a different mindset and in a sense, learning about this difference taught me to appreciate it more. I also learnt to work more to my strengths, and as well as my weaknesses to improve them. 

#### What have you learnt about your own practice during this trimester?

I'm very set in my ways, so sometimes I am hesistant to try different ways of doing things. But the way for me to learn is my practice, and that means it dosen't have be my own practice I put forth. 

#### What areas are you planning on improving next trimester?

I think the area I want to continue improving is communication. I felt that this semester, I've been making improvements, and I know I can continue it. Espeically with things that I'm really confident about, I let it be heard. Then we can discuss it. The live gig had many different times, where I had a million ideas because I know what gose into a live gig, and I'd pitch it to the team. Then I just realize, some of the ideas aren't practical for the scale of the event we're doing.
