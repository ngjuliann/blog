  Looking forward to hearing the finished remix. I'm not sure what the original
  sounds like but make sure you focus on a style and direction. Be aware that
  arpeggiators can't help you to find notes, but you may be able to utilise some
  of the techniques we used in last Friday afternoon's class in working out
  chord progressions.
